# SOEN6111-Project
Forecasting and predicting is one of the hottest trends in the industry, especially in retail stores, for setting up appropriate inventory, achieving benchmark service levels, and so on. In this project, we will implement various models to estimate the unit sales of Walmart retail goods. We will aim to achieve better calibrated and more accurate forecasts while appreciating the uncertainties. We will be using the M5 forecasting dataset provided by the University of Nicosia, which comprises the following files:
1.	calendar.csv - Contains information about the dates on which the products are sold. [1]
2.	sales_train_validation.csv - Contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store [1]
3.	sell_prices.csv - Contains information about the price of the products sold per store and date. [1]
4.	sales_train_evaluation.csv - Includes sales. [1]

More details to follow in the project proposal.
